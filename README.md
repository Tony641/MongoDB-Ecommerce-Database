## Database Schema
The database schema is designed to support a modern e-commerce platform. Key collections include:
- **Users**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and addresses.
- **Products**: Stores product details, including variants and images.
- **Orders**: Tracks customer orders and their status.
- **Reviews**: Handles product reviews and ratings.
- **Support Tickets**: Manages customer complaints and inquiries.

For a detailed schema design, refer to the [Schema Documentation](#).

## Collections
Here are the main collections in the database:

1. **Users**
   - Stores user information, authentication methods, and addresses.
2. **Products**
   - Manages product details, including variants, images, and stock.
3. **Orders**
   - Tracks customer orders, payments, and shipping details.
4. **Reviews**
   - Handles product reviews and ratings.
5. **Support Tickets**
   - Manages customer complaints and inquiries.
6. **Banners**
   - Stores promotional banners and their redirect links.
7. **Categories and Subcategories**
   - Organizes products into categories and subcategories.
8. **Wishlists**
   - Tracks user wishlists.
9. **Audit Logs**
   - Logs critical actions for security and compliance.

For a full list of collections and their fields, see the [Collections Documentation](#).

## Transactions
The database includes prebuilt transactions to ensure data consistency:
1. **Place Order**: Creates an order, updates stock, and adds the order to the user's history.
2. **Cancel Order**: Cancels an order and restores product stock.
3. **Process Return**: Handles product returns and updates inventory.
4. **Update Product**: Updates product details and variants atomically.
5. **User Registration**: Creates a user and their default address in a single transaction.

For implementation details, see the [Transactions Documentation](#).

---

## Triggers and Events
The database uses MongoDB Change Streams and scheduled events for automation:
1. **Review Added Trigger**: Updates product ratings when a new review is added.
2. **Order Status Update Trigger**: Sends notifications when an order status changes.
3. **Daily Sales Report**: Generates a daily sales report.
4. **Monthly Archive**: Archives old orders to a separate collection.

For more details, see the [Triggers and Events Documentation](#).

## Backup and Recovery
The database includes strategies for regular backups and disaster recovery:
1. **Daily Backups**: Full database backups stored locally or in the cloud.
2. **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restores the database to a specific timestamp.
3. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Steps to recover from catastrophic failures.

For backup scripts and recovery procedures, see the [Backup and Recovery Documentation](#).
